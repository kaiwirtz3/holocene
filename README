MATLAB and R-scripts for the analysis of
 archaeological C14 and paleoclimate proxy data
 kai wirtz (Hereon) Dec 2023
-------------------------------------------------------

Code and data availability:
https://github.com/kaiwirtz3/holocene

The MATLAB and R code enables standalone or parallel processing.
For example, parallel processing of batch jobs can be invoked on HPC by "sbatch --array=1-64 slurm.sh"

-------------------------------------------------------
Requirenments:
  MATLAB
   needs packages: 'M_MAP' and 'pca_toolbox'
   insert/correct installation path in 'addpath('~/tools/m_map')' found in the header of some MATLAB-scripts (foremost load_par.m),
   or 'addpath('~/tools/pca_toolbox')' in proxy_dtw.m

  R
   needs libraries: rworldmap, rcarbon, R.matlab, RColorBrewer, cluster, sp/sf
   for rcarbon version <1.5 see comments in grid_growth.r ("spweights")

-------------------------------------------------------
Input data
  (in directories c14mat/ paleoclim/ and data/)

  Note that the input data are already available in pre-processed binary (MATLAB) format.

  The  C14 dates from the p3k14c dataset were downloaded in Mar 2023 from
  https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01118-7/tables/4.
  Updates can be found at https://www.p3k14c.org
  The p3k14c csv/xls file can be converted by "read_dASIS.m" (see outcommented settings) to
  "c14mat/p3k14c.mat" (needed by "merge_C14data.m")
  The new compilation refers to the database dASIS which in turn collects previous databases
  and adds own dates compiled by Gronenborn/Antunes at LEIZA Mainz
  The xls file "c14mat/C14_dASIS.xlsx" was converted by runing "read_dASIS.m"
  to "c14mat/C14_dASIS.mat"
  Using the script "merge_C14data.m", all binary files for pooled and gridded were produced

   c14mat/C14_europe_[1-64].mat:  radiocarbon dates for Europe on a coarse grid
   c14mat/C14_europe0.mat:        radiocarbon dates for Europe pooled
   c14mat/C14_[cont].mat:         radiocarbon dates for continents
   c14mat/C14_NIreland.mat:       radiocarbon dates for North Ireland
   c14mat/C14_dASIS.xlsx:         compilation of (dASIS) C14v dates in XLS format

  collected paleoclimate proxy time-series and meta-info in
    paleoclim/InEur_27_920.mat:   index ('InEur') to proxies in EU domain
    paleoclim/proxydescription_488_0_11.00_1.70.mat: MATLAB structure ("evinfo") with all paleoclimate info
      for 209 records. used indices areigven by 'InEur'
      meta-info:
       e.g., "Proxy" for proxy type, "Plotname" for site name, "Latitude", "Longitude"
        or "Source" for bibtex-key of original reference
      evinfo.time:  cells with vectors containing the time values of a record
      evinfo.value: cells with vectors containing the normalized values

  misc time-series or fields
    SA_spd_rgr.mat: RGR South America from digitized and calculated from Riris et al 2019
    Steinhilber2012_Solar.dat: Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) from Steinhilber et al 2012
    bog_std.mat: Northern Irish bog data by Rowan McLaughlin
    seamask_norm_0.05.mat: landmask Europe at 0.05 degree resolution

-------------------------------------------------------
Execution:
-------------
all scripts can be invoked by a single master shell command: "./master.sh"
 this seriel processing may take some time depending on computational resources;
time consuming script processing such as of 'spd_growth.r' or 'cluster.r' can be run at a HPC in parallel mode
(see also slurm.sh)

for running R-scripts (e.g."r-example.r"):  start 'R' terminal and type 'source("r-example.r")'
                                or from (bash) terminal, type  'Rscript r-example.r'
for running MATLAB-scripts (e.g."m-example.m"): start MATLAB terminal and type 'm-example'
                                or from (bash) terminal, type  'matlab -nodesktop -r "try; m-example; catch; end; quit" '
